# AI for SHM Workshop

This repository contains all materials, notebooks, and resources used in the **AI for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) Workshop**.  
The notebooks are built for hands-on learning covering data preprocessing, machine learning, and neural networks applied to wind turbine SCADA data.

The notebooks can be run instantly using **Google Colab** or **Binder**, avoiding any local installation issues.
